Question 1:-  package com.xworkz.app;

public class FindMinMax {
     void maximun(int []a,int as)
	{
    	 int i;
    	 int max=a[0];
    	 
		for(i=0;i<as;i++)
		{
				if(a[i]>max)
				{
					max=a[i];
				}		
		}
			
			System.out.println("the maximinum number is "+max);
			
	}
     void minimun(int []a,int as)
 	{
     	 int i;
     	 int max=a[0];
     	 
 		for(i=0;i<as;i++)
 		{
 				if(a[i]<max)
 				{
 					max=a[i];
 				}	
 		}
 			
 			System.out.println("the minimum number is "+max);
 	}
 			
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a[]= {45,333,76,23,474,654,29,454};
		 FindMinMax f=new FindMinMax();
		 f.maximun(a,a.length);
		 f.minimun(a,a.length);
		 

	}

}



Question2:-  package com.xworkz.app;

public class InLoveOddEven {
	public boolean love(int flower1,int flower2 )
	{
		boolean inlove=false;
		if(flower1%2==0 && flower2%2==0)
		{
			
			inlove=true;
		}
			
		return inlove;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		 
		InLoveOddEven in=new InLoveOddEven();
		System.out.println("In love "+in.love(2,2));

	}

}


Question 4:-a):- by making the class constructor private.
            b):- java.lang.String,  java.lang.Math are final classes.
            c):- Deligates can be an alternative to inheritance.

Question 5:- A Set that maintains its elements in ascending order, sorted according to the elements' natural ordering or according to a Comparator provided at SortedSet creation time.

Question 6:- Array List:- 1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.	
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory.	
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.	
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
5) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.	

Linked List
1)LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
2)Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
3)LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4)LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
5)The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.

Question 7:-ListIterator:-ListIterator can help to replace an element whereas Iterator cannot.
            Iterator    :-Iterator can traverse only in forward direction whereas ListIterator traverses both in forward and backward directions.

Question 8:-The covariant method overriding approach, implemented in Java 5, helps to remove the client-side typecasting by enabling you to return a subtype of the overridden method's actual return type. Covariant Method overriding means that when overriding a method in the child class, the return type may vary.

Question 10:-static polymorphism:- when there are multipal functions with same name but different in parameters the thes functions are said to be overloading
             Dynamic polymorphism:-if sub class has the same method as declaried in the parent class with the same parameter is said to be override
